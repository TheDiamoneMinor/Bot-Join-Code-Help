# Bot-Join-Code-Help
Whenever I attempt the $join command, there's an error message that pops up that's in one of the three files provided. I don't know how to fix it, leaving the code to whoever receives the link to this github (which will be deleted once the problem has been resolved) to help fix the issue. I have provided the whole code in case there's something that I missed, which will include the code of question (lines 154-204) in there.

Much thanks to whoever can help and best of luck with coding.
